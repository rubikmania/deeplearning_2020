You may use techniques below.\n","\n","1. Experiment with different hyperparameters: epochs, learning rate, etc.\n","2. We used a fixed learning rate epsilon for gradient descent. Implement an annealing schedule for the gradient descent learning rate ([more info](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#anneal)). *Hint*. Try using `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ExponentialLR()`.    \n","3. We used a tanh activation function for our hidden layer. Experiment with other activation functions included in PyTorch.\n","4. Extend the network to multiple hidden layers. Experiment with the layer sizes. Adding another hidden layer means you will need to adjust the code. \n","5. Introduce and tune regularization method (e.g. L2 regularization) for your model. Remeber that L2 amounts to adding a penalty on the norm of the weights to the loss. The right amount of regularization should imporve your validation / test accuracy.\n","\n","\n","**Evaluation:** You will get full credit if your best test accuracy exceeds <font color=red>$93\\%$</font>.
